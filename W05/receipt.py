  Program must contain at least these two functions:
    - main

import csv

def main():
  print('All Products')
  print()
  products_dic = read_dictionary('products.csv', 0)
  print(products_dic)
  print()
  print('Requested Items:')
  print()

  with open('request.csv') as csv_file:
    reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    next(reader)
    for line in reader:
      product_id, quantity = line
      print(f'{products_dic[product_id][1]}: {quantity} @ {products_dic[product_id][2]}')

  print()

def read_dictionary(filename, key_column_index):
  '''
    Read the contents of a CSV file into a compound
    dictionary and return the dictionary.
    
    Parameters

    Return: a compound dictionary that contains
        the contents of the CSV file.
