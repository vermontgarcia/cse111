CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

    WeatherApp

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

    This app will help to have in hand the weather information regarding
    current conditions and the forecast of the day and the forecast for 
    the next 3 days (This is what I can access from the Weather API with
    a free subscription)

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

    Several topics are on the table. The one that is higlited is that I 
    will learn about Kivy Frmework and how to integrate this technology
    with python to make a program more user friendly. Other very important
    will be how classes work in Python and how to work with them.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

    - Kivy
    - pytest
    - requests
    - datetime
    - os

5. List the names of functions you will need?

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

    - get_current_weather
    - get_forecast
    - update_image
    - save_image
    - get_current_data
    - get_forecast_data
    - update_gui_main
    - update_gui_forecast

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

    - test_get_current_weather
    - test_get_forecast
    - test_get_current_data
    - test_get_forecast_data
